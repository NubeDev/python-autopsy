# Functions & Modules

## Reusing Code

__Code reuse__ is a very important part of programming in any language. Increasing code size makes it harder to maintain.

For a large programming project to be successful, it is essential to abide by the __Don't Repeat Yourself__, or __DRY__, principle.
We've already looked at one way of doing this: by using loops. In this module, ewe will explore two more: functions and modules.

Bad, repetitive code is said to abide by the __WET__ principle, which stands for __Write Everything Twice__, or __We Enjoy Typing__.

## Functions

You've already used __functions__ in  previous lessons.
Any statement that consists of word followed by information in __parentheses__ is a function call.

Here are some examples that you've already seen:
```python
print("Hello world!")
range(2,20)
str(12)
range(10,20,3)
```
The words in front of the parentheses are function __names__, and the comma-separated values inside the parentheses are function __arguments__.

In addition to using pre-defined functions, you can create your own function by using the `def` statement.
Here is an example of a function named `my_func`. It takes no arguments, and
